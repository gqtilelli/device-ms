device-ms

The purpose of this microservice is to keep the record of devices.
The device entity is composed by:
o Device name
o Device brand
o Creation time
The supported operations are:
1. Add device;
2. Get device by identifier;
3. List all devices;
4. Update device (full and partial);
5. Delete a device;
6. Search device by brand;
The file swagger.ymal contains the Restful API definition.

Database
The tests need that a MongoDB database is running in the local machine.
To run a MongoDB server using Docker, use the command: make runmongo
A docker client, for example Docker Desktop, has to be installed and running in local machine.

go-swagger
go-swagger is used to generate code for integration tests (itests)
go-swagger executable "generate-swagger-client" is installed with the following command:
go install github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger@latest
And adding its directory to the PATH. For example, in a Mac:
add the following line to the end of login script (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc, for example):
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin

mockery
mockery is used to generate mocks for interfaces for use in tests.
To install mockery, the following command is used:
go get github.com/vektra/mockery/v2/../

Automated Tests
To execute the tests, use the command: make tests
A Mongodb has to be available in default port 27017 of local machine. Se Database above.
There are unit tests for database operations (mongo), model and controller.
The handler is covered by the integration tests (itests).
Example:
make test
.
. (test code automatic generation from swagger (go-swagger) and mockery (mocks for interfaces) 
.
go test -cover ./controller ./mongo ./model ./itests/device
ok  	github.com/device-ms/controller	(cached)	coverage: 93.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/device-ms/mongo	(cached)	coverage: 70.6% of statements
ok  	github.com/device-ms/model	(cached)	coverage: 100.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/device-ms/itests/device	(cached)	coverage: [no statements]

Run device-ms
To run device-ms in local machine (with mongo runnning in local machine too - see Database above), run: make rundevice
If successful, the prompt won't return and the tests can be executed for example with curl from another terminal:
~ curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/device' 
[]
~ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/device' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "jupiter",
    "brand": "brand1" 
}'
{"id":"676b240a7bbab556f4a6b57b","name":"jupiter"}
Ëœ curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/device'   
[{"id":"676b240a7bbab556f4a6b57b","name":"jupiter","brand":"brand1","createdAt":"2024-12-24T21:13:46Z"}]
The accepted brands are defined by source code (device-ms/model/enums.go) and the accepted values are:
brand1
brand2
brand3
